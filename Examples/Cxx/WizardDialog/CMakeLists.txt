# We define several classes in this example, and we want to be able to use
# their C++ methods as callbacks for our user interface. To do so, we need to 
# create a library and wrap it automatically for the Tcl language, which
# is used as a bridge between C++ objects at run-time. Note that an
# initialization function is automatically created in this library to allow
# classes and C++ methods to be used as commands and callbacks inside the Tcl
# interpreter; do *not* forget to call this function right after you 
# initialize the Tcl interpreter in your application. The name of this 
# function is built from the library name in lower-case (except for the first
# letter) and suffixed with "_Init" (for example: 
# KWWizardDialogExampleLib => Kwwizarddialogexamplelib_Init)
# This whole process is required to use C++ methods as callbacks; it is not
# needed if you use VTK's C++ command/observer pattern directly, which is
# demonstrated in KWWidgets's C++ 'Callbacks' example.
