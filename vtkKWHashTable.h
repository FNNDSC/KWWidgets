// .NAME vtkKWHashTable - hash table to be used in VTK
// .SECTION Description
// vtkKWHashTable is a simple implementation of the hash table
// It can store arbitrary pointers and hash based on arbitrary 
// pointer, provided the hashing function is specified.
// It knows nativly how to hash unsigned long numbers and 
// strings.

#ifndef __vtkKWHashTable_h
#define __vtkKWHashTable_h

#include "vtkKWObject.h"

// This is the initial number of buckets
#define KW_HASHTABLE_INITIAL_NUMBER_OF_BUCKETS 101

class vtkKWHashTableItem;

{
public:

  // Description:
  // This is a prototipe for the hashing function. When 
  // performing a insert, lookup, or remove with an arbitrary 
  // pointer (void*), this function has to be set, so that 
  // hash table will know how to convert the object into the
  // unsigned long number.
  typedef unsigned long HashFunctionType( void * );

  // Description:
  // Set the function that hashes void* into unsigned long.
  // The prototype should be somthing like:
  // unsigned long HashFunction( void * );
  vtkSetMacro( HashFunction, HashFunctionType );

  // Description:
  // Set and get the number of buckets.
  // NOTE: when setting the number of buckets, the code is missing
  // that will reorganize the hash elements in the buckets.
  vtkSetMacro( NumberOfBuckets, unsigned int );
  vtkGetMacro( NumberOfBuckets, unsigned int );

  // Description:
  // Get the number of entries stored in the hash table
  vtkGetMacro( Size, unsigned int );
  
  // Description:
  // Access an item in the hash table
  // Return values:
  // non-NULL    The item in question was found; the return value is
  //             a pointer to the corresponding record in the hash table.
  // NULL        The item was not found in the hash table. Either it just
  //             isn't in there, or the hash function returned an error.
  void *Lookup( unsigned long );

  // Description:
  // Insert: Insert an item into the hash table
  // Return values:
  // nonzero     The item was inserted successfully
  // zero        The item could not be inserted. Either the function could
  //             not allocate the amount of memory necessary to store it,
  //             or the hash table already contains an item with the same
  //             key, or the hash function returned an error.
  // Note:
  // If you know for sure that key values are in fact unique identifiers,
  // that is, that the calling functions will never try to make the hash
  // table contain two items with the same key at the same time, you can
  // speed up the function considerably by deleting the first statement.
  int Insert( unsigned long, void * );
  int Insert( void *, void * );

    { return this->Insert( vtkKWHashTable::HashString( str ), data ); }

  // Description:
  // Remove an item from the hash table
  // Return values:
  // nonzero     The item was removed successfully.
  // zero        The item could not be removed. Either it just wasn't
  //             found in the hash table, or the hash function returned
  //             an error.
