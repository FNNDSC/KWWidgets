// .NAME vtkKWRadioButtonSet - a "set of radio buttons" widget
// .SECTION Description
// A simple widget representing a set of radio buttons. Only one button
// can be selected at a time, and this widget takes care of unselection/selection
// by sharing the same variable name among the radio buttons. Radiobuttons
// can be created, removed or queried based on unique ID provided by the user
// (ids are not handled by the class since it is likely that they will be defined
// as enum's or #define by the user for easier retrieval, instead of having
// ivar's that would store the id's returned by the class).
// Since the radiobuttons share the same variable name, each button needs to be
// assigned a unique value too. This value is the id by default. 
// Radiobuttons are packed in the order they were added.
