1) What is tkdnd?
   "tkdnd" is a tk extension that adds native support for drag and drop (dnd)
   under some platforms (typically unix and windows). Under unix there is
   support for the Motif and the XDND protocol. Under windows, OLE dnd is
   used.

2) I have a widget that is able to accept a specific type as a drop target,
   but dropping on this widget from another application does not seem to work
   correctly. What is wrong?

   Try to define a binding script for the <DragEnter> event. Remember that a
   well behaved drop target widget must have a binding script for each one of
   the following events: <DragEnter>, <Drag>, <Drop>. <DragLeave> is not
   important for drag & drop, but it is important for reseting the widget to
   its normal appearence.

3) Other Unix applications do not recognise my toplevels as drop targets. I am
   able to use dnd within the same tk application, but not with other apps.

   You probably have forget to call "update" before defining drag sources/drop
   targets. Usually, after doing a drag from a tk toplevel, the widgets in this
   toplevel are then recognised by other applications as drop targets. Make
   sure that you use "update" before using the "dnd" command on any tk widget.
   The recomended strategy is to first create all widgets in the window, place
   them, call update and then arrange the dnd stuff...
