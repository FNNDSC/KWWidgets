// .NAME vtkKWUserInterfacePanel - a user interface panel.
// .SECTION Description
// This class is used to abstract the way an interface "panel" can be subdivided
// into "pages" (i.e. "sections"). It allows specific GUI parts of an application
// to be encapsulated inside independent panels. Panels are then associated to 
// a user interface manager (see vtkKWUserInterfaceManager) which is responsible 
// for grouping them inside a widget and handling user interaction so that
// panels and their pages can be selected in more or less fancy ways. 
// If the user interface manager uses a notebook under the hood, then this class
// is likely to receive a notebook's page when it will request for a page from
// the manager. If the manager chooses for a flat GUI, then this class is likely
// to receive a simple frame that will be stacked by the manager on top of
// other pages.
// This class is not a widget, it can not be mapped, the manager is the
// place where a concrete widget is set and used as the root of all panels (see
// vtkKWUserInterfaceNotebookManager for example). What you need to do
// is to set the UserInterfaceManager's Ivar to a manager, and the rest should
// be taken care of (i.e. the panel is automatically added to the manager, 
// and if the panel is not created the first time one if its pages is shown or 
// raised, the panel's Create() method is automatically called by the manager, 
// allowing the creation of the panel to be delayed until it is really needed).
// You should not use the manager's API to add the panel, add or raise pages,
// etc, just use this panel's API and calls will be propagated to the 
// right manager with the proper arguments).
