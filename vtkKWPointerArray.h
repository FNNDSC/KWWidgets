// .NAME vtkKWPointerArray - hash table to be used in VTK
// .SECTION Description
// vtkKWPointerArray is a simple implementation of the dynamic array

class VTK_EXPORT vtkKWPointerArray : public vtkKWObject
{
public:

  // Description:
  // Set and get the number of buckets.
  // NOTE: when setting the number of buckets, the code is missing
  // that will reorganize the hash elements in the buckets.

  // Get the number of entries stored in the hash table

  // Description:
  // Access an item in the hash table
  // Return values:
  // non-NULL    The item in question was found; the return value is
  //             a pointer to the corresponding record in the hash table.
  // NULL        The item was not found in the hash table. Either it just
  //             isn't in there, or the hash function returned an error.

  // Description:
  // Insert: Insert an item into the hash table
  // Return values:
  // nonzero     The item was inserted successfully
  // zero        The item could not be inserted. Either the function could
  //             not allocate the amount of memory necessary to store it,
  //             or the hash table already contains an item with the same
  //             key, or the hash function returned an error.
  // Note:
  // If you know for sure that key values are in fact unique identifiers,
  // that is, that the calling functions will never try to make the hash
  // table contain two items with the same key at the same time, you can
  // speed up the function considerably by deleting the first statement.
  int Append( void * );

  // Description:
  // Remove an item from the hash table
  // Return values:
  // nonzero     The item was removed successfully.
  // zero        The item could not be removed. Either it just wasn't
  //             found in the hash table, or the hash function returned
  //             an error.
