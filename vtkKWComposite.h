// .NAME vtkKWComposite - an element in a view containing props / properties
// .SECTION Description
// A composite represents an element in the view. It is very similar to
// the notion of an actor in a renderer. The composite is different in 
// that it combines the Actor (vtkProp actually) with some user interface
// code called the properties, and it may also contain more complex
// elements such as filters etc.

  // Methods to indicate when this composite is the selected composite.
  // These methods are used by subclasses to modify the menu bar
  // for example. When a volume composite is selected it might 
  // add an option to the menu bar to view the 2D slices.

  // Description:
  // Give a composite a chance to close. Called from the vtkKWView when
  // it is closed. The default behavior is to do nothing - can be
  // overridden in a subclass for example to close dialogs.
